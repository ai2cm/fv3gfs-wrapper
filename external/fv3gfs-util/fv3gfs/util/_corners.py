fill_scalar_corners

The fill_corners routines put data into tile corners to make stencil operations more
convenient.

The corners themselves do not map on to anything meaningful. At, say, the southwest
corner of a tile, the south edge and west edge correspond to different cube faces.
However, there is no cube face across the southwest corner - it's the edge between
the two adjacent tiles.

(Figures as below depict grid cells near the edge of a tile domain. All symbols except
for C represent halo data.)

W: west neighbor tile
S: south neighbor tile
C: compute domain
?: corner data, with no meaningful tile

However, when applying stencils to the data, it is useful to make use of these corners.
Take for example a stencil along the x-axis. This stencil might be applied in the
south halo, as below:

X: 3-by-1 stencil being moved along the domain

Something interesting happens when the stencil tries to compute at the outermost
point. It wants to grab data from the western tile face, across the edge boundary
separating those two tiles!

X: 3-by-1 stencil being applied across tile edge

WXWCCC

In order to do this, the west tile data is copied into the corner before the 3-by-1
stencil is called. Numbering the west-tile points, the data is copied like so:

123CCC
456CCC
789CCC
369SSS
258SSS
147SSS

This allows the 3-by-1 stencil to be applied naturally. Note the new X position within
the corner is being applied on the same number as the point across the edge
shown earlier.
