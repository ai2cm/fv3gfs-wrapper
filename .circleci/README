# Setting up GCR Container repo

Several of these steps need to be performed via a web console, and cannot be
scripted. This is to avoid placing senstive information like Google cloud keys
in version control.

1. Create a service account with the appropriate permissions, and generate its
key using these commands:

    accountName=circleci-sa
    fullAccount=$accountName@vcm-ml.iam.gserviceaccount.com

    gcloud beta iam service-accounts create $accountName \
        --description "Service account for Circle CI"

    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create keys.json --iam-account $fullAccount

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding vcm-ml \
        --member serviceAccount:$fullAccount \
        --role roles/storage.admin

this saves a `key.json` file containing the google key.

2. Set the following environmental variables in [Circle CI's web console](https://circleci.com/gh/VulcanClimateModeling/fv3gfs/edit#env-vars).
  a. GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY. copy paste contents of key.json into this entry
  b. GOOGLE_COMPUTE_ZONE=us-central-1a
  c. GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=vcm-ml

After these steps, Circle CI should be able to authenaticate with google using
the `gcp-gcr/gcr-auth` command in `config.yml`.
