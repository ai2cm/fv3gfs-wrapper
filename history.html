<h2>v0.6.0 (2021-01-27)<a class="headerlink" href="#v0-6-0-2021-01-27" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Breaking changes:
- Removed many fv3util imports from fv3gfs, import those symbols from fv3gfs.util instead
- Removed initial cache data from fv3gfs-wrapper image</p>
<p>Major changes:
- Use <cite>cftime.datetime</cite> objects to represent datetimes in fv3gfs-python and fv3util instead of <cite>datetime.datetime</cite> objects.  This results in times stored in a format compatible with the fortran model, and accurate internal representation of times with the calendar specified
in the <cite>coupler_nml</cite> namelist.
- Fortran source updated to include new per-physics-component tendency diagnostics for temperature and specific humidity, and to ensure that the column moistening implied by nudging specific humidity is subtracted from the precipitation felt by the land surface model.
- The wrapper now passes runtime flags similarly to physics and dynamics properties but in a class structure, so ptop is accessible as <cite>wrapper.flags.ptop</cite>.
- <cite>build_deps</cite> and <cite>push_deps</cite> make targets are removed from <cite>docker/Makefile</cite>. Use the make targets in fv3gfs-fortran instead.
- Added <cite>fv3gfs.wrapper.examples</cite> module with an example random forest corrector model, which can be enabled if the dependency extras option <cite>sklearn_json</cite> is selected.</p>
<p>Minor changes:
- added jenkins scripts under .jenkins
- Dawn is removed from the fv3gfs-wrapper test image
- Makefile in lib no longer depends on fv3gfs configuration files, since they were not actually being used.
- CC used for <cite>python setup.py build_ext –inplace</cite> is now specified directly in the Makefile (default gcc), since docker was somehow using different compilers locally and in CI
- add <cite>Sfcprop%tsfco</cite> and <cite>Sfcprop%tsfcl</cite> to <cite>physics_properties.json</cite>
- added baroclinic and state-saving cases to <cite>examples/runfiles</cite>
- added GMD paper examples with timings to <cite>examples/gmd_timings</cite></p>

<h2>v0.5.0 (2020-07-28)<a class="headerlink" href="#v0-5-0-2020-07-28" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Breaking changes:
- fixed a bug where atmosphere hybrid coordinates were incorrectly marked as cell center variables, and were missing one point
- <cite>send_buffer</cite> and <cite>recv_buffer</cite> are modified to take in a <cite>callable</cite>, which is more easily serialized than a <cite>numpy</cite>-like module (necessary because we serialize the arguments to re-use buffers), and allows custom specification of the initialization if zeros are needed instead of empty.
- use remote data for restart conditions</p>
<p>Major changes:
- Added getters and setters for additional dynamics quantities needed to call an alternative dynamical core
- fv3config is updated to v0.4.0, “default” data options for initial conditions and forcings, as well as functions get_default_config and ensure_data_is_downloaded have been removed
- <cite>get_state</cite> and <cite>open_restart</cite> have been modified so they can optionally accept a target state dictionary in which to insert variables. <cite>get_state</cite> also can take in an allocator, which manages initialization concerns like halo allocation or the use of storages instead of numpy arrays.
- added <cite>storage</cite> property to Quantity, implemented as short-term shortcut to .data until gt4py GDP-3 is implemented</p>
<p>Minor changes:
- Internally, get_state uses the new QuantityFactory class to initialize quantities
- fixed bug in fv3util setup.py which prevented <cite>python setup.py install</cite> from copying submodules
- fixed bug in dockerfile where gs://vcm-fv3config data was downloaded to incorrect location
- New hpc dockerfiles
- aquaplanet configuration</p>
<p>Deprecations:
- <cite>Quantity.values</cite> is deprecated</p>

- Change units of <cite>surface_precipitation_rate</cite> output from m/s to mm/s.</p>
</div>

<h2>v0.4.2 (2020-05-12)<a class="headerlink" href="#v0-4-2-2020-05-12" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Breaking changes:
- Signature of <cite>TilePartitioner.subtile_slice</cite> has changed to avoid needing to construct a metadata object in order to use two of its attributes. Instead, those attributes (tile_dims and tile_extent) are directly passed.
- <cite>finish_halo_update</cite> and <cite>finish_vector_halo_update</cite> are now disabled and will raise <cite>NotImplementedError</cite>.</p>
<p>Major changes:
- Add functionality to get <cite>surface_precipitation_rate</cite> in <cite>get_state</cite>. Equal to <cite>total_precipitation</cite> divided by the physics timestep.
- Add QuantityFactory class which creates Quantity objects from dimensionality, units, and dtype
- Add SubtileGridSizer class which determines the origin, extent, and shape of data to be allocated for a given dimension name. This class is used by QuantityFactory to determine the shape of storages to allocate.
- added <cite>make test_mpi</cite> directive to fv3util which runs mpi tests using mpirun, added this to test_docker
- buffers will be created for any data which is not c-contiguous, to avoid transposing data during MPI transport
- <cite>start_halo_update</cite> now returns a “request” object which must be completed with <cite>.wait()</cite>
- <cite>halo_update</cite> is added which performs a blocking halo update
- <cite>start_vector_halo_update</cite> now returns a “request” object which must be completed with <cite>.wait()</cite>
- <cite>vector_halo_update</cite> is added which performs a blocking vector halo update
- Updated fv3gfs-fortran submodule to c0d11c6a. Important changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sfcprop%tprcp is set to zero on init when dycore=True</p></li>
<li><p>Add option (<cite>restart_from_agrid_winds</cite> in <cite>fv_core_nml</cite>) to restart model from lat/lon A-grid horizontal winds</p></li>
<li><p>Fix issue where physics diagnostics were accumulating when output interval equaled physics timestep</p></li>
<li><p>Add functionality (<cite>write_coarse_restart_files</cite> in <cite>fv_core_nml</cite>) to do online coarse-graining of restart files on model levels</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Minor changes:
- Fixed a bug in building from cached intermediate images where the fv3gfs-fortran image would not use the cached ESMF and FMS images
- removed tags from halo update routines, as they are not yet necessary for use cases we’ve created and were not being properly treated
- tests are refactored to use new halo update interfaces
- added some mpi communicator tests which use more realistically large amounts of data
- Corrected units for total_precipitation variable</p>

- Updated fv3gfs-fortran submodule to 42f2877a. Important changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Addition of <cite>do_gfdl_mp_in_physics</cite> and <cite>do_only_clearsky_rad</cite> namelist parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Physical constants in model changed to <cite>GFS_PHYS</cite> versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Preliminary online coarse-graining code infrastructure introduced.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>fv3config updated to 0.3.2</p></li>
<li><p>Added a Makefile for building docker images in docker/Makefile</p></li>
<li><p>build_docker.sh and CircleCI will by default pull intermediate build dependency images instead of rebuilding them. These can be rebuilt manually using the Makefile in <cite>docker</cite>.</p></li>
<li><p>DummyComm now refuses to accept non-contiguous buffers, the same as mpi4py</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Minor changes:
- Replaced latent and sensible heat fortran variable names with instantaneous versions instead of cumulative. Updated units of total_precipitation.
- gcsfs updated to 0.6.0
- added backoff to dockerfile, is a new requirement for fv3config
- create empty outdir in dockerfile, required to allow run_docker to upload to a remote outdir
- add .c files to <cite>make clean</cite> in <cite>lib</cite>. These are produced as build artifacts of cython.</p>

<h2>v0.4.0 (2020-04-03)<a class="headerlink" href="#v0-4-0-2020-04-03" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Major changes:
- Added Quantity object to replace DataArray in the state dictionary. Quantity.view[:] provides something akin to DataArray.values, except that it may be a cupy or numpy array. Quantity.values is a read-only numpy array.
- Partitioner has been replaced by TilePartitioner
- Added TilePartitioner and CubedSpherePartitioner objects for domain decomposition.
- Added TileCommunicator and CubedSphereCommunicator objects for inter-rank communication.
- Tile scattering is now in <cite>TileCommunicator.scatter</cite>.
- Added <cite>to_dataset(state)</cite> which turns a state dictionary into an xarray Dataset object.
- Added constants <cite>X_DIM, X_INTERFACE_DIM, Y_DIM, Y_INTERFACE_DIM, Z_DIM, Z_INTERFACE_DIM, X_DIMS, Y_DIMS, HORIZONTAL_DIMS</cite>, and <cite>INTERFACE_DIMS</cite>
- updated ZarrMonitor, <cite>get_state</cite>, <cite>set_state</cite>, <cite>open_restart</cite>, <cite>apply_nudging</cite>, <cite>get_nudging_tendencies</cite>, <cite>read_state</cite>, <cite>write_state</cite> and tests to work with a Quantity-based state.
- updated <cite>open_restart</cite> to work with the new communicator objects
- Removed <cite>without_ghost_cells</cite> and <cite>with_ghost_cells</cite>, as a ghost-cell independent view is now available as <cite>Quantity.view</cite>.
- examples are updated for the new code and now run on CircleCI
- gt4py is included in the <cite>fv3gfs-python</cite> image
- <cite>Quantity.from_storage</cite> and <cite>Quantity.storage</cite> are removed - storages are treated the same as if they were numpy/cupy arrays. To retrieve the storage, use <cite>Quantity.data</cite> on a quantity that has been initialized from a storage object.
- All tests using numpy arrays now also run using gt4py <cite>CPUStorage</cite> objects.
- Added <cite>compute_physics</cite> and <cite>apply_physics</cite> functions, which separately do the physics and apply the output of the physics routines to the atmospheric prognostic state.
- Update Fortran sources. Major change is addition of <cite>use_analysis_sst</cite> namelist option.
- getters/setters are added for longitude, latitude, gridcell area, and surface/top of atmosphere upward/downward shortwave/ longwave all-sky/clear-sky fluxes (for combinations which exist in the Fortran model).
- Added a key “fortran_subname” to physics_properties which can currently only be used for 2D physics variables, to indicate the property name for variables stored in arrays of structs. A side-effect is that “fortran_name” is no longer unique for 2D physics variables, since a fortran struct array can contain multiple subname variables under a single fortran_name.
- Tile gather operation is implemented in <cite>TileCommunicator.gather</cite>
- vector halo updates are implemented in <cite>CubedSphereCommunicator.start_vector_halo_update</cite> and <cite>CubedSphereCommunicator.finish_vector_halo_update</cite>.
- Interface-level halo updates were fixed to match fv3gfs behavior. The outermost values on interface level variables are in the compute domain on both ranks bordering it, and are not sent at all during halo update. Instead, the next three interior values are sent.
- Added framework for testing MPI mock against mpi4py, with tests for Scatter, Gather, Send/Recv, and Isend/Irecv.
- ZarrMonitor chunk size along horizontal and vertical dimensions are now as intended, fixing a bug which set the chunk size for the first two dimensions to 1</p>
<p>Minor changes:
- Added C12 regression test for <cite>open_restart</cite>
- added scipy and pytest-subtests to requirements and docker container
- fixed docker container so that <cite>dev_docker.sh</cite> no longer overwrites ESMF and FMS installations
- Removed the old  “integration” tests, as their functionality (at least what was enabled) is covered entirely by the newer “image” tests which are compared against the results from the pure-fortran repo.
- Incremented fv3config commit to include fix to version string
- Add getters/setters for temperature_after_physics, eastward_wind_after_physics, northward_wind_after_physics
- Fixed a bug in <cite>dev_docker.sh</cite> where the Fortran sources weren’t being bind-mounted, only the Python files
- tests are added for scalar and vector rotation
- concurrency issues in the MPI mock now raise a custom <cite>ConcurrencyError</cite>.
- Fixed two counter-acting bugs: rotation now rotates in the correct direction, and halo updates now appropriately rotate arrays counter to the relative rotation of the axes on the two tiles, instead of in the same direction as that rotation
- Files are fixed to pass our style checks
- CircleCI tests style checks, will only build image if linting passes (since it’s a long job). Pure python tests will run alongside linting tests (since they’re fast)
- Makefile at top level only includes configure.fv3 if it exists, since it will not exist during linting tests
- Added tests for <cite>array_chunks</cite> routine used by ZarrMonitor.</p>

<div class="section" id="v0-3-1">
<h2>v0.3.1<a class="headerlink" href="#v0-3-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Major changes:
- In order to facilitate testing of pure python code, this PR splits code that has no dependencies on the Fortran wrapper into its own subpackage, <cite>fv3util</cite>. That code then gets imported and used by the <cite>fv3gfs</cite> python package.
- Removed legacy restart loading code (<cite>load_fortran_restart_folder</cite>). This will be added back in a future PR with better logic for identifying dimensions in restart data, using the properties dictionaries.
- <cite>Partitioner</cite> class added to handle domain decomposition and inter-rank communication
- filesystem module added to use fsspec to handle remote locations
- Added logic to manage model properties into fv3util. Dynamics and physics properties are stored at the package level in JSON files, while tracer properties are registered externally. This allows support for different microphysics packages and field tables, and allows the wrapper to automatically register the tracers being used by the present model configuration.
- Added <cite>open_restart</cite> routine to load restart files. One rank per tile loads the file, and then distributes the data over MPI to each other process. Can choose to load only a subset of the variables to reduce data transfer when the directory is remote.
- Added <cite>apply_nudging</cite> and <cite>get_nudging_tendencies</cite> functions to nudge a model state to a reference state according to given timescales and a timestep.
- Added <cite>ZarrMonitor</cite> object which stores a sequence of model states in a Zarr store. Data is chunked such that each process is responsible for one chunk (with the last process being responsible for two chunks, in the case of interface-level variables).
- Significant additions and reworks to documentation. Removed outdated build instructions and added docker-centric build instructions. Added developer notes about fv3util.
- Added docs-docker make target to build docs inside docker
- Removed old, unused <cite>get_output_array</cite> routine in the <cite>_wrapper.so</cite>.</p>
<p>Minor changes:
- fixed bug where master branch was not pushing untagged images to GCR
- fixed <cite>fv3util.__version__</cite> variable to indicate the correct version (0.3.0)
- Nudging example runfile added
- Updated target fortran sources, requiring small tweaks to docker build instructions
- Added docstrings to any routines missing them in the API docs
- Removed recommended installation targets for apt-get and reduced the number of RUN commands in docker to reduce disk space requirements for intermediate images
- Added new dependencies for zarr writing and documentation building to docker image
- Changed documentation theme to readthedocs theme
- Added IDE directory to gitignore</p>

<h2>v0.3.0<a class="headerlink" href="#v0-3-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Major changes:
- Fortran sources are updated from the older fv3gfs repo to the newer fv3atm repo. Running the model is the same, but small changes to the repo require different namelist options when running the model, so configuration dictionaries will need to be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>Minor changes:
- Fixed name of “patch” version in RELEASE.rst
- Docker build instructions are used directly from the Fortran repo, instead of copying build instructions in two places.
- The new repo requires ESMF and FMS to be built separately
- 32bit builds are disabled, will require fixing the build steps in fv3gfs-fortran to properly pass 32bit build flags when building FMS. Flags can still be sent to fv3atm the same way as before.
- Fortran build sources are back to being a PHONY build target, because make was not able to follow through and build them.
- Regression tests are added that use the regression target data in the fv3gfs-fortran repo. This makes some of our other tests redundant, they may be removed later.
- Configuration dictionaries are explicitly specified for tests instead of using <cite>get_default_config</cite>.
- Commented-out restart tests are re-introduced as fixing restarts on the new repo is a work in progress.</p>
